# Predicting Energy Consumption with XGBoost
### Overview

Developed a regression model using XGBoost to forecast regional energy consumption over a 10-year period, leveraging time-based patterns in the data.

### Key Achievements

- Engineered time series features (hour, day, month, etc.) to capture seasonal trends
- Visualised consumption patterns using boxplots for daily and weekly variance
- Tuned model with early stopping and learning rate adjustments to reduce overfitting
- Analysed feature importance; identified hour and month as key drivers
- Evaluated model using RMSE and conducted error analysis on best/worst prediction days

### Outcomes

- Accurately forecasted energy demand trends based on interpretable time-based signals
- Demonstrated the value of time series forecasting for anticipating grid demand, managing renewable energy inputs, and preparing for consumption surges
- Outlined clear next steps: integrate holiday and weather data, perform cross-validation, and handle outliers to further boost model performance
